#Meme generator 

##Tools used:
-React.js
-Javascript
-HTML
-CSS
-NPM

I am using this as a simple project to learn more about React.js, the replicated API call data is in a file called memes-data.js, unfortunately some of those photo have a lot of white space within them inside of the images themselves. Seems more like a problem with the images as I do not want to stretch them. Often times the text will appear inside of the actual image but unfortunately the image itself, operating as it should, had uncropped white space and the text looks mis-placed. Just using this project to learn more about React, and to not get caught up in API resources that aren't really performing that well! Just an fyi aside on the project (: ! 

(Project loosely based off of Scrimbas free React course!)
